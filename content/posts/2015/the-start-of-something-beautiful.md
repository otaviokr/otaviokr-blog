I started this blog because I *like* to write. I *need* to write. And right now, things are placed perfectly to 
(re)start this little pet project: I want to interact more with [Github](http://www.github.com/otaviokr), I'm learning
[Go](http://www.golang.org), and I've just found out about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and the idea of having an engine to 
generate static web-pages makes the whole point of having a blog more as a *repository of ideas* with minimum maintance 
is just too good to ignore. 

So, while I'm studying this new language, trying out new ideas and finding out some curious facts, I'm also writing. 
But I must confess I know this won't be exclusively a blog about development, despite being one of my favourite topics: 
I'm just an ordinary nerd and I can't help being excited for all the usual things nerds love: movies, TV series, games 
and so on. If you're reading this site, I bet you'll like to talk about those things as well; if not, just skip those 
posts that you don't find interesting and come back anytime to check for new blog entries. And don't hesitate to leave 
a message: I may avoid talking about the Marvel super-hero universe if everybody who reads my blog are more a DC person.

Anyways, expect to find a lot of **series** here: a stream of many topics talking about only one theme and that should 
be read as one long post. I'll try to keep a small *table of contents* of some sort so readers can easily jump from one 
post to another, but I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to do that, so keep an eye for links on posts.

Also, I'm posting this right after having the system installed, and I expect to play around to customize the layout 
(perhaps even creating my own Hugo theme?) sometime in the near future, and I'll appreciate any input, both about 
what to change in the current layout as to what include/exclude/modify in the new custom theme. I'll try to post my 
findings and a walkthrough the whole process, but I'm not sure if that will be possible or even interesting...

All source codes, examples and projects I'll be using in this blog will be available at my  
[Github repository](http://www.github.com/otaviokr): feel free to enjoy them as you like - I just kindly ask to always 
point where you find them! And, please, let me know too - not only I'll be very proud to see that others find my work 
interesting, but I might as well publish here!
 
As expected, any suggestion and/or question are more than welcome! The blog still doesn't have any kind of comment 
functionality, but you can find my on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/okrofatto)!
